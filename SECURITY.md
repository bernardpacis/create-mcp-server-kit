# Security policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you’ve found a security issue, please **do not** open a public issue.

Instead, send a private report to the maintainer(s) via GitHub Security Advisories (preferred), or open an issue asking for a contact channel.

## Supported versions

Only the latest minor version in the `main` branch is supported.
